# Windows-Background-Changer
Short script to change windows desktop background outside of the settings by replaceing the cached jpg your computer stores.

If you can you really should just use the settings.

To use just drag and drop any .jpg image onto it, after your computer restarts your Desktop background should be changed to that image.
It also saves your current background image to the directory of the script incase you ever want to undo it.

This has only been tested on Windows 10.
